# HoleNews Scripts

Python-based scripts used for utility/misc non-runtime functions of HoleNews

## Script List

- `maphexes.py`: Formats map hexes from warapi into a Rust enumeration; essentially auto-generated most of the `map.rs` file.
- `templatetest.py`: Flask server with embedded pseudo-database to mimic the final product, used to rapidly debug frontend. Now outdated.
